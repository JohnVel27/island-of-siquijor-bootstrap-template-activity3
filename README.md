# Siquijor Island Tourism Website

## Overview

This project is a customized website template designed to showcase the beauty of Siquijor Island and attract tourists to visit. The website serves as an informative platform, featuring various attractions, accommodations, activities, and travel information for visitors. It was developed with the goal of promoting the island’s natural wonders and cultural richness.

## Design Template

The website design is based on the [Travela Template](https://themewagon.com/themes/travela/), which I downloaded from Themewagon. I customized it to align with the branding and themes of Siquijor Island, focusing on visuals and content that highlight the island’s unique offerings.
